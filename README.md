# graphql-server-json-file

Just a little helper for json-graphql-server which creates a GraphQL API server based on JSON data. This repo reads the JSON data from a file (default name: "db.json" in the same directory) and starts the server -- that's it. It contains a small and simple demo data file to play with. 

See [json-graphql-server](https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server) for further documentation.
