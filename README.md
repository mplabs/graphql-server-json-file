# graphql-server-json-file

Just a little helper for [json-graphql-server](https://github.com/marmelab/json-graphql-server) which creates a GraphQL API server based on JSON data. This little repo reads the JSON data from a file and starts the server. It contains a small and simple demo data file to play with.
